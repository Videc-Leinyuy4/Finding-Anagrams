# Finding-Anagrams
Program to accept two strings and determine if they are anagrams.

How the Program Works:
1. User must enter both the strings stored in separate variables.
2. The characters of both the strings are sorted.
3. They are then checked whether they are equal or not using an if or else statement.
4. If they are equal, the function returns true if not it returns false.
